Another JEE todo application
============================

[preface]
Why another Todo app ?
----------------------
This was just an excuse to start playing with arquillian and selenium. +
The target server is Glassfish because since arquillian comes from JBoss I wanted to be sure there was no adherence to a particular Application Server.

The todo-ear-all is composed of two artifacts :

- an EJB jar with a simple task service with remote access enable
- an war with a simple ui consuming that task service

The todo-ear has only the EJB packaged in it, so the that the war can be deployed separately.

Development environment setup
-----------------------------
Standard maven setup and JDK 1.6. +
The configured database is  an H2 one.

How to build the app
--------------------
Just run `mvn install` from root folder.
