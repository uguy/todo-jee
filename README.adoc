Another JEE todo application
============================

[preface]
Why another Todo app ?
----------------------
This was just a excuse to start playing with arquillian and selenium. +
The target server is Glassfih because since arquillian comes from JBoss I wanted to be sure there was no adherence to a particular Application Server.

The ear is composed of two artifacts :

- an EJB jar with a simple task service
- an war with a simple ui consuming that task service

Development environment setup
-----------------------------
Standard maven setup and JDK 1.6. +
The configured database is  MySQL one called `members` with `root:root` pair for login/password.

How to build the app
--------------------
One the database is up, just run `mvn install` from root folder.
